Uncertainty Investment and Managerial Incentives: 

By Brent Glover and Oliver Levine (2015) 

Managerial Incentives, shaped by compensation contracts, help to explain the empirical relationship between uncertainty and investment. They propose a model where a manager is compensated with an equity based contract and makes decisions for a firm that faces time-varying volatility. 

Can we see think of the optimal policy of the firm in terms of a mechanism-design problem that depends on the nature of the distribution of the uncertainty shocks? Could this penalty for the agent if they adjust their investment discretionarily micro-found adjustment costs? 

Perhaps professional executives are more able to be punished by boards and this threat means that it is easier to enforce investment alignment. 

Difference in the Guilluime case,the private information was a theta, here it is the distribution theta is drawn from. Does this matter?

Most shocks to uncertainty also move the expected productivity lower no? So how do you disentangle the impact? 

If σ is small, we can use a first-order Taylor expansion eσ≈1+σeσ≈1+σ, making it approximately linear in σσ

Log-Linearity probably won't work for the volatility states because the value function will non-linearly depend on them. But can I make things linear using the stochastic discount factor? Perhaps that the SDF has a form with an exponent?
